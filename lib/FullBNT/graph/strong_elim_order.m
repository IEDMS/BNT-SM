% STRONG_ELIM_ORDER Find an elimination order to produce a strongly triangulated graph.
% order = strong_elim_order(moral_graph, node_sizes, partial_order)
% 
% partial_order(i,j)=1 if we must marginalize i *after* j
% (so i will be nearer the strong root).
% e.g., if j is a decision node and i is its information set:
%   we cannot maximize j if we have marginalized out some of i
% e.g., if j is a continuous child and i is its discrete parent:
%   we want to integrate out the cts nodes before the discrete ones,
%   so that the marginal is strong.

% On p369 of the Jensen paper, they state "the reverse of the elimination order must be some
% extension of [the partial order] to a total order".
% We make no attempt to find the best such total ordering, in the sense of minimizing the weight
% of the resulting cliques.

% Example from the Jensen paper:
% Let us number the nodes in Fig 1 from top to bottom, left to right,
% so a=1,b=2,D1=3,c=4,...,l=14,j=15,k=16.
% The elimination ordering they propose on p370 is [14 15 16 11 12 1 4 5 10 8 13 9 7 6 3 2];
