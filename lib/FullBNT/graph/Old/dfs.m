function [d, pre, post, height, cycle, pred] = dfs(adj_mat, start, directed)
% DFS Perform a depth-first search of the graph starting from 'start'.
% [d, pre, post, height, cycle, pred] = dfs(adj_mat, start, directed)
%
% d(i) is the time at which node i is first discovered.
% pre is a listing of the nodes in the order in which they are first encountered (opened).
% post is a listing of the nodes in the order in which they are last encountered (closed).
% A node is last encountered once we have explored all of its neighbors.
% If the graph is directed, i's neighbors are its children.
% If the graph is a tree, preorder is parents before children, and
% postorder is children before parents.
% For a DAG, topological order = reverse(postorder).
% height(i) is the height (distance) of node i from the start.
% 'cycle' is true iff a (directed) cycle is found.
% pred(i) is the parent of i in the dfs tree rooted at start.
% See Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest, "An intro. to algorithms" 1994, p478.

% We can detect undirected cycles by checking if we are about to visit a node n which we have
% already visited. To detect *directed* cycles, we need to know if n has been closed or is still open.
% For example (where arcs are directed down)
%   1    2
%   \   /
%     3
% Assume we visit 1, 3 and then 2 in order. The fact that a child of 2 (namely, 3) has
% already been visited is okay, because 3 has been closed.
% The algorithms in Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman, and Sedgewick, do not detect directed cycles.
