% COMPUTE_INTERFACE_NODES Find the nodes in a DBN that represent a sufficient statistic
% [int, persist, transient] = compute_interface_nodes(intra, inter)
%
% The interface nodes are all those that has an incoming temporal arc,
% or which have a child which has an incoming temporal arc,
% where a temporal arc means one coming from the previous slice.
% (The parents of nodes with incoming temporal arcs are needed
% because moralization will bring them into the clique.)
%
% The persisent nodes are all those that have one or more incoming temporal arc.
% The transient nodes are all the non-persistent.
