% A graph with different kinds of nodes (e.g., discrete and cts, or decision and rnd) is called marked. 
% A strong root is guaranteed to exist if the marked graph is triangulated and does not have any paths of
% the form discrete -> cts -> discrete. In general we need to add extra edges to
% the moral graph to ensure this (see example in Lauritzen (1992) fig 3b).
% However, a simpler sufficient condition is to eliminate all the cts nodes before the discrete ones,
% because then, as we move from the leaves to the root, the cts nodes get marginalized away
% and we are left with purely discrete cliques.
%
% partial_order(i,j)=1 if we must marginalize j *before* i
% (so i will be nearer the strong root).
% If the hidden nodes are either all discrete or all cts, we set partial_order = [].
