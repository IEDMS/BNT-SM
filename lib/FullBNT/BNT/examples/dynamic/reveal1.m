% where all arcs point down. In addition, there are persistence arcs from each node to itself.
% There are no intra-slice connections.
% Nodes have noisy-or CPDs.
% Node 1 turns on spontaneously due to its leaky source.
% This effect trickles down to the other nodes in the order shown.
% All the other nodes inhibit their leaks.
% None of the nodes inhibit the connection from themselves, so that once they are on, they remain
% on (persistence).

% This model was used in the experiments reported in
% - "Learning the structure of DBNs", Friedman, Murphy and Russell, UAI 1998.
% where the structure was learned even in the presence of missing data.
% In that paper, we used the structural EM algorithm.
% Here, we assume full observability and tabular CPDs for the learner, so we can use a much
% simpler learning algorithm.
