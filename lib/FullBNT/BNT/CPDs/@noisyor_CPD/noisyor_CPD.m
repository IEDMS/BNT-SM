% NOISYOR_CPD Make a noisy-or CPD
% CPD = NOISYOR_CPD(BNET, NODE_NUM, LEAK_INHIBIT, INHIBIT)
%
% A noisy-or node turns on if any of its parents are on, provided they are not inhibited.
% The prob. that the i'th parent gets inhibited (flipped from 1 to 0) is inhibit(i).
% The prob that the leak node (a dummy parent that is always on) gets inhibit is leak_inhibit.
% These params default to random values if omitted.
%
% Example: suppose C has parents A and B, and the
% link of A->C fails with prob pA and the link B->C fails with pB.
% Then the noisy-OR gate defines the following distribution
%
%  A  B  P(C=0)
%  0  0  1.0
%  1  0  pA
%  0  1  pB
%  1  1  pA * PB
%
% Currently, learning is not supported for noisy-or nodes
% (since the M step is somewhat complicated).
%
% For simple generalizations of the noisy-OR model, see e.g.,
% - Srinivas, "A generalization of the noisy-OR model", UAI 93
% - Meek and Heckerman, "Learning Causal interaction models", UAI 97.
