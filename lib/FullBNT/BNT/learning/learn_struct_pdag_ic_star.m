% LEARN_STRUCT_PDAG_IC_STAR Learn a partially oriented DAG (pattern) with latent 
% variables using the IC* algorithm
% P = learn_struct_pdag_ic_star(cond_indep, n, k, ...)
%
% n is the number of nodes.
% k is an optional upper bound on the fan-in (default: n)
% cond_indep is a boolean function that will be called as follows:
% feval(cond_indep, x, y, S, ...)
% where x and y are nodes, and S is a set of nodes (positive integers),
% and ... are any optional parameters passed to this function.
%
% The output P is an adjacency matrix, in which
% P(i,j) = -1 if there is either a latent variable L such that i <-L-> j 
% OR there is a directed edge from i->j.
% P(i,j) = -2 if there is a marked directed i-*>j edge.
% P(i,j) = P(j,i) = 1 if there is and undirected edge i--j
% P(i,j) = P(j,i) = 2 if there is a latent variable L such that i<-L->j.
%
% The IC* algorithm learns a latent structure associated with a set of observed 
% variables. 
% The latent structure revealed is the projection in which every latent variable is
% 1) a root node
% 2) linked to exactly two observed variables.
% Latent variables in the projection are represented using a bidirectional graph, 
% and thus remain implicit.
