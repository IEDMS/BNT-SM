% LEARN_STRUCT_DBN_REVEAL Learn inter-slice adjacency matrix given fully observable discrete time series
% inter = learn_struct_dbn_reveal(seqs, node_sizes, max_fan_in, penalty)
% 
% seqs{l}{i,t} = value of node i in slice t of time-series l.
%   If you have a single time series in an N*T array D, use
%      seqs = { num2cell(D) }.
%   If you have L time series, each of length T, in an N*T*L array D, use
%      seqs= cell(1,L); for l=1:L, seqs{l} = num2cell(D(:,:,l)); end
%   or, in vectorized form,
%      seqs = squeeze(num2cell(num2cell(D),[1 2]));
% Currently the data is assumed to be discrete (1,2,...)
%
% node_sizes(i) is the number of possible values for node i
% max_fan_in is the largest number of parents we allow per node (default: N)
% penalty is weight given to the complexity penalty (default: 0.5)
%  A penalty of 0.5 gives the BIC score.
%  A penalty of 0 gives the ML score.
%  Maximizing likelihood is equivalent to maximizing mutual information between parents and child.
%
% inter(i,j) = 1 iff node in slice t connects to node j in slice t+1
%
% The parent set for each node in slice 2 is computed by evaluating all subsets of nodes in slice 1,
% and picking the largest scoring one. This takes O(n^k) time per node, where n is the num. nodes
% per slice, and k <= n is the max fan in.
% Since all the nodes are observed, we do not need to use an inference engine.
% And since we are only learning the inter-slice matrix, we do not need to check for cycles.

% D(1:n, i) is the i'th input and D(n+1, i) is the i'th output.

% We concatenate each sequence separately to avoid treating the transition
% from the end of one sequence to the beginning of another as a "normal" transition.
