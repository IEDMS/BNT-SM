% The DBN is converted to an HMM with a single meganode, but the observed nodes remain factored.
% This can be faster than jtree if the num. hidden nodes is low, because of lower constant factors.

% All hidden nodes must be discrete.
% All observed nodes are assumed to be leaves, i.e., they cannot be parents of anything.
% The parents of each observed leaf are assumed to be a subset of the hidden nodes within the same slice.
% The only exception is if bnet is an AR-HMM, where the parents are assumed to be self in the
% previous slice (continuous), plus all the discrete nodes in the current slice.
