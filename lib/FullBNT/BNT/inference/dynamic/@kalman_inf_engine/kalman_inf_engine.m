% 'onodes' specifies which nodes are observed; these must be leaves.
% The remaining nodes are all hidden. All nodes must have linear-Gaussian CPDs.
% The hidden nodes must be persistent, i.e., they must have children in
% the next time slice. In addition, they may not have any children within the current slice,
% except to the observed leaves. In other words, the topology must be isomorphic to a standard LDS.

% There are many derivations of the filtering and smoothing equations for Linear Dynamical
% Systems in the literature. I particularly like the following
