% FRONTIER_INF_ENGINE Inference engine for DBNs which which uses the frontier algorithm.
% engine = frontier_inf_engine(bnet)
%
% The frontier algorithm extends the forwards-backwards algorithm to DBNs in the obvious way,
% maintaining a joint distribution (frontier) over all the nodes in a time slice.
% When all the hidden nodes in the DBN are persistent (have children in the next time slice),
% its theoretical running time is often similar to that of the junction tree algorithm,
% although in practice, this algorithm seems to very slow (at least in matlab).
% However, it is extremely simple to describe and implement.
%
% Suppose there are n binary nodes per slice, so the frontier takes O(2^n) space.
% Each time step takes between O(n 2^{n+1}) and O(n 2^{2n}) operations, depending on the graph structure.
% The lower bound is achieved by a set of n independent chains, as in a factorial HMM.
% The upper bound is achieved by a set of n fully interconnected chains, as in an HMM.
%
% The factor of n arises because we need to multiply in each CPD from slice t+1.
% The second factor depends on the size of the frontier to which we add the new node.
% In an FHMM, once we have added X(i,t+1), we can marginalize out X(i,t) from the frontier, since
% no other nodes depend on it; hence the frontier never contains more than n+1 nodes.
% In a fully coupled HMM, we must leave X(i,t) in the frontier until all X(j,t+1) have been
% added; hence the frontier will contain 2*n nodes at its peak.

% We maintain 3 sets: the frontier (F), the right set (R), and the left set (L).
% The invariant is that the nodes in R are d-separated from L given F.
% We start with slice 1 in F and slice 2 in R.
% The goal is to move slice 1 from F to L, and slice 2 from R to F, so as to minimize the size
% of the frontier at each step, where the size(F) = product of the node-sizes of nodes in F.
% A node may be removed (from F to L) if it has no children in R.
% A node may be added (from R to F) if its parents are in F.
%
% ns(i) = num. discrete values node i can take on (i=1..ss, where ss = slice size)
% dag is the (2*ss) x (2*ss) adjacency matrix for the 2-slice DBN.
