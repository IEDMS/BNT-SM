% QUICKSCORE_INF_ENGINE Exact inference for the QMR network
% engine = quickscore_inf_engine(inhibit, leak, prior)
%
% We create an inference engine for QMR-like networks.
% QMR is a bipartite graph, where the top layer contains hidden disease nodes,
% and the bottom later contains observed finding nodes.
% The diseases have Bernoulli CPDs, the findings noisy-or CPDs.
% The original QMR (Quick Medical Reference) network has specific parameter values which we are not
% allowed to release, for commercial reasons.
%
% inhibit(f,d) = inhibition probability on f->d arc for disease d, finding f
% If inhibit(f,d) = 1, there is effectively no arc from d->f
% leak(j) = inhibition prob. on leak node -> finding j arc
% prior(i) = prob. disease i is on
%
% We use exact inference, which takes O(2^P) time, where P is the number of positive findings.

% Note that this algorithm is numerically unstable, since it adds a large number of positive and
% negative terms and hopes that some of them exactly cancel.
