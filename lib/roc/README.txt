Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve Tools
An ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a plot of the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate of a classifier system as the score defining the decision threshold is varied. This toolkit implements some of the basic methods for constructing and processing ROC curves discussed by Fawcett [1] and Provost and Fawcett [2]. The area under the ROC curve is a reasonable performance statistic for classifier systems assuming no knowledge of the true ratio of misclassification costs.
