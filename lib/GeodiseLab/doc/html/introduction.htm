<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Geodise Toolboxes provide a collection of

functions that extend the capability of the Matlab<sup>&reg;</sup>

technical computing environment. The Geodise Compute, Database and

XML toolboxes contain routines that facilitate many aspects of Grid

computing and data management including:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type="disc">

<li class="MsoNormal">The submission and management of

computational jobs on remote compute resources via the Globus GRAM

service.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">File transfer and remote directory management

using the GridFTP protocol.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Single sign-on to the Grid with Globus proxy

certificates.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Storage and grouping of files and variables,

annotated with user defined metadata, in an archive.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Graphical and programmatic interfaces for

querying the metadata to easily locate stored files and

variables.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Sharing and reuse of data among distributed

users. Users may grant access to their data to other members of a

<i>Virtual Organisation</i>.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Conversion of Matlab structures and variables

into a non-proprietary, plain text format (XML) which can be stored

and used by other tools.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Conversion of almost any type of XML document

including WSDL descriptions of Web Services into Matlab's struct

format or cell data type.</li>

</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Grid computing provides the infrastructure for

the collaborative use of computers, networks, data, storage and

applications across distributed organisations. A computational job

can be run on the Grid to make use of resources unavailable on the

user&rsquo;s desktop, for example to exploit software licenses or

greater computational power. The Geodise Compute Toolbox provides

Matlab functions for submitting and monitoring jobs on the Grid,

transferring files to and from remote compute resources, and

managing the certificates used to identify users and authorise use

of the resources.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Compute intensive applications often use and

produce many data files and data structures. It can become

difficult to find, reuse and share data from various applications

that have been run repeatedly with different parameters. The

Geodise Database Toolbox can be used to store additional

user-defined information (called metadata) describing files and

Matlab variables, so that they can be located and retrieved more

easily with metadata queries. Files and variables can also be

grouped together, and data can be shared with other users by

granting access permissions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">XML is a flexible standard data format that is

widely used to structure and store information, and to exchange

data between various computer applications. The XML Toolbox

functions convert and store Matlab variables and structures from

the internal format into XML and vice versa. This allows parameter

structures, variables and results from computational applications

to be stored in a non-proprietary file format, or in XML-capable

databases, and can be used to transfer Matlab data across the Grid.

Comparing arbitrary Matlab structures was not previously possible,

but this can be now achieved by comparing their XML representation.

The XML toolbox also enables the transparent exchanges of data

between the Matlab technical computing environment and the Jython

scripting environment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This user guide introduces the reader to the

Compute, Database and XML toolboxes, with tutorials that give an

overview of the functionality provided by each of the toolboxes.

The function reference for each toolbox contains detailed

information about the syntax of its functions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104279197" id="_Toc104279197">Use Cases</a></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">The GeodiseLab toolboxes have applications in

a wide range of scenarios. Here we will outline three use cases

that describe the potential benefits of Grid computing to the daily

practice of the scientist or engineer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The use cases that we will discuss are:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type="disc">

<li class="MsoNormal">Engineering Design Search and

Optimisation</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Data management in computational

electromagnetics</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Transparent collaboration between Problem

Solving Environments</li>

</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Engineering Design Search and Optimisation</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">Engineering Design Search and Optimisation

(EDSO) is a compute and data intensive task which is well matched

to Grid computing. Optimisation algorithms are used to search the

parameter space of an engineering problem to discover an optimal

design subject to certain criteria. During EDSO the optimisation

algorithm must repeatedly evaluate some measure of the quality of a

design; this may involve one or more lengthy numerical

calculations. For example, an engineer wishing to improve the

aerodynamic performance of a wing design may configure an optimiser

to vary key design parameters, whilst invoking simulations of

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to determine the <i>quality</i>

of alternative geometries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Depending upon the complexity of the numerical

calculations and the number of evaluations required to determine

the optimum design, EDSO may be a lengthy and computationally

intensive task. When the evaluation of the objective function

involves complex simulations (i.e. CFD) numerous large data files

may be required, or produced, by the numerous calculations. The

Grid client functionality makes it straightforward for the engineer

to leverage computational resources available on the Grid to

perform EDSO.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When undertaking EDSO using one of the many

optimisation algorithms available in the Matlab environment the

engineer may use the Geodise Compute toolbox to automate the

transfer of files, and the submission and management of

computational jobs required during the evaluation of a design. By

exploiting Grid resources not only is the engineer able to leverage

the greater computational power available, but he can also drive

any applications that he requires on a multitude of platforms from

the comfort of his desktop PSE.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Data management in computational electromagnetics</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">Data management is an issue in a number of

scientific and engineering application domains, including that of

computational electromagnetics. For example, when performing

simulations of electromagnetic phenomena a large volume of data may

be generated, typically in the form of the input and output files.

It is a non-trivial problem for the researcher to store, manage and

reuse this data. The investment associated with the computationally

expensive Finite Difference Time Domain modelling technique used to

explore the properties of electromagnetic devices require that

simulation results are suitably managed for reuse at a later

data.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At present the most common solution for this

problem is to store these flat files within a hierarchical

directory structure on a local file system. As the volume of data

grows over time this solution is frequently inadequate for long

term storage since it may become increasingly difficult to locate

and reuse data within the collection. The Geodise Database toolbox

provides a solution as a client to a managed data archive on the

Grid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Geodise Database Toolbox allows the

researcher to archive data files to a managed repository from the

Matlab environment and annotate these files with metadata. In

addition to standard metadata the user may define custom metadata

specific to the problem. The researcher can then query the metadata

to find these files using straightforward syntax within the Matlab

environment. In addition the Geodise Database Toolbox supports the

archiving of variables from the Matlab environment. Items in stored

the repository can be associated together into datagroups, allowing

the creation of annotated hierarchies within which the user's

results can be organised.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Transparent collaboration between Problem Solving

Environments</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Geodise XML toolbox provides a collection

of straight-forward functions which convert variables in the Matlab

environment to and from the external XML format. Variables in the

Matlab workspace can be saved to and loaded from an XML file with

minimal effort on the part of the researcher. XML is a structured

format that can be interpreted by third party applications. By

encoding the Matlab variables in the XML format there are a number

of benefits.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The provision of the Geodise XML toolbox for

Jython allows the transparent exchange of variables between the

Matlab technical computing environment and Jython scripting

environment. Variables are mapped to the appropriate built-in

datatypes in the two languages. This allows researchers working

with these two Problem Solving Environments to collaborate on

shared datasets.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Geodise XML toolbox is also leveraged by

the Geodise Database Toolbox to store variables and metadata in a

database. The contents of variables and metadata in the database

can then be queried and searched across. The Geodise Database

toolbox may be used to share variables stored in the managed

repository between members of a virtual organisation because

researchers can authorise other users to access their data. When

variables are retrieved from the repository they will be

transparently converted into the built-in datatypes of that

PSE.</p>
